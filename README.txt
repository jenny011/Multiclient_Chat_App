We have prepared a more readble README.md on our Github page.
Github page: https://github.com/jenny011/Multiclient_Chat_App
It contains contents of both HOWTO.txt and README.txt.

---------------------
 |Please Note that |
---------------------
1. Use Python 3.6+.
2. All the data are stored at the server. Once the server is stopped, everything happened in the app is erased.
3. Safari and Firefox periodically drop inactive TCP connections after timeout. If you find the chat interface not working (eg. messages not being sent), please simply refresh the page.
4. For a better user experience, give the browser windows a reasonable size.
